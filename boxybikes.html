        <h1>Boxy Bikes Website Re-Design</h1>
        <div class="text">
          Our final project for INFO 1300 Intro to Web Design & Programming,
          was a group project. We reached out to the local business, Boxy Bikes,
          to re-design their website, which they had been using for six years.
          For a couple of weeks, my teammates and I divided the work of designing,
          user testing, and coding. In the end, we completed a functional, modern website
          for college students to use.

          <div class="text">
            Our client wanted to attract a younger crowd to their business. Our
            target audience, college students, are more
            likely to gravitate towards convenient and sleek designs.

            <div class="text">
              <p>
              The class project had two parts: first, we had to re-design the website
              from existing content; second, we had to create a form using Javascript
              that relates to the website and audience.</p>
              <p>I considered what sort of information my target
              audience would find necessary and/or useful. I wrote
              out each piece of information on a sticky note, then
              grouped the information in a way in which users find
              the most reasonable and convenient.</p>

            <h3>User Testing</h3>
            <div class="text">
              <p>I coded an initial draft of the website based on the sketches I drew. I conducted user
              testing on two users, both Cornell students and as close to my target
              audience as possible. I gave my users four tasks to perform:</p>
              <table class="tasks">
                <tr>
                  <td>1</td>
                  <td>Suppose you are going to the Apple Festival on Saturday afternoon for two hours.
                    You will be taking the bus from Statler Hall. Find the bus that will take you to the
                    Apple Fest from there.
                  </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>2</td>
                  <td>You are thirsty and a little tired. Find a place that you can buy caffeinated
                    beverages.
                  </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>3</td>
                  <td>You want to attend the Cider Trail event.
                  Find and download the Cider Trail passport so you can print
                  it out before you arrive.
                  </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>4</td>
                  <td>It's almost 3PM. Find a performance you can
                    watch at 3PM and the location of the performance.
                  </td>
                </tr>
              </table>
              <p>I found a few problems with my initial design that
                my users found crucial to navigating the website:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Users don't know whether a new page has loaded.</li>
                <li>Users took a while to find which buses to take.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>To solve the user problems, I decided to add the following features
                to better the user experience:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Create feedback to show when the new page has loaded.</li>
                <li>Format buses to be read more quickly and easier.</li>
              </ul>
