        <h1>Apple Festival Website Re-Design</h1>
        <div class="text">
          For the class, INFO 1300 Intro to Web Design & Programming,
          we were asked to re-design a functional website for the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival to
          fit the user audience that we have chosen (see initial website
          <a href="https://www.downtownithaca.com/apple-harvest-festival/">here</a>).
          It was an individual project that spanned the course of a couple weeks. I was
          able to gain experience in designing, user testing, and coding in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

          <h2>Design Process</h2>
          <div class="text">
            My target audience primarily includes Cornell University students who
            are going to the festival for the first time. These students are usually
            tech-savvy, but they are also busy and disorganized, as they
            often plan or prepare for events at the last minute.

            <h3>Persona</h3>
            <div class="text">
            I modeled the following persona after my own experiences at the Apple Fest, as well as my
            friends, whom also have had the experiences of attending the Apple
            Festival for the first time.

            <div class="text">
              <p>
              The class project had two parts: first, we had to re-design the website
              from existing content; second, we had to create a form using Javascript
              that relates to the website and audience.</p>
              <p>I considered what sort of information my target
              audience would find necessary and/or useful. I wrote
              out each piece of information on a sticky note, then
              grouped the information in a way in which users find
              the most reasonable and convenient.</p>

            <h3>User Testing</h3>
            <div class="text">
              <p>I coded an initial draft of the website based on the sketches I drew. I conducted user
              testing on two users, both Cornell students and as close to my target
              audience as possible. I gave my users four tasks to perform:</p>
              <table class="tasks">
                <tr>
                  <td>1</td>
                  <td>Suppose you are going to the Apple Festival on Saturday afternoon for two hours.
                    You will be taking the bus from Statler Hall. Find the bus that will take you to the
                    Apple Fest from there.
                  </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>2</td>
                  <td>You are thirsty and a little tired. Find a place that you can buy caffeinated
                    beverages.
                  </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>3</td>
                  <td>You want to attend the Cider Trail event.
                  Find and download the Cider Trail passport so you can print
                  it out before you arrive.
                  </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>4</td>
                  <td>It's almost 3PM. Find a performance you can
                    watch at 3PM and the location of the performance.
                  </td>
                </tr>
              </table>
              <p>I found a few problems with my initial design that
                my users found crucial to navigating the website:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Users don't know whether a new page has loaded.</li>
                <li>Users took a while to find which buses to take.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>To solve the user problems, I decided to add the following features
                to better the user experience:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Create feedback to show when the new page has loaded.</li>
                <li>Format buses to be read more quickly and easier.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
